# Hey there!

Welcome to my personal website.

My name is František, and I was born in Czechoslovakia in 1980. I'm a happy father of two and a husband to one.

I enjoy discovering and browsing personal websites. After discovering static sites generators, I decided to contribute my own piece of weirdness. :)

So have fun — here or anywhere else!
