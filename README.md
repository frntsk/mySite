### About
A repository for my personal website, created using [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy).

There isn’t much to look at here — especially if you're a developer. This is a very basic 11ty application.

However, if you're not a developer and have just started exploring 11ty, you might want to check out the repository’s [Wiki pages](https://github.com/frntsk/mySite/wiki). I’ve documented most of the steps and features I used while building this website. It’s a simple example of what can be achieved with 11ty even by someone like me (= not really technical person)!
